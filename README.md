# ATM-Simulation-System

## Project Description:
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Simulation will simulate real world ATM machines. The ATM Simulation will allow customer console for interaction with the customer, a slot for depositing money, a way to withdraw an amount. The ATM simulation will generate a customer receipt when a user withdraws an amount.
The ATM Machine will serve a single customer at a time. The customer will be required to put personal identification number (PIN) which will be validated before allowing the customer to deposit or withdraw an amount. The customer will be able to perform single or multiple transactions. The system will allow the customer to receive printed receipt for successful transactions.


## Project Working:
The ATM Simulation will allow the ability to provide the following services to the customers: 
1.	Customer will be able to withdraw cash from their account if enough amount is present in their account.
2.	Customer will be able to deposit cash in their account which will be linked to the customer based on personal identification number (PIN). The customer will enter the amount of the deposit into the ATM.
3.	Customer will be able to transfer an amount between two different accounts.
4.	Customer will be able to inquiry about their current balance by first validating using personal identification number (PIN).
